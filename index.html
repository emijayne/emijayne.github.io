	<p>Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the world. This site is primarily about my professional and creative side.. so it is a bit of a mix code and crochet.</p>

	<p>Currently, I am working as a Programmer/Developer/Database Analyst/Production Artist at the moment. I really love making systems for my end users more efficient, easy and beautiful. Because of this, I am constantly learning new technologies, languages and techniques.</p>

	<p>Personally, I am a wife and mom of four boys and two dogs. We live in the middle of farm country, in a cute little town on the Jersey side of the Delaware River.</p>

	<p>My interests and passions lie where art and science intersect: baking, crocheting, programming, gardening, puzzles.. and reverse engineering anything I find interesting. My simple pleasure, though, is reading... anything from biographies and Biblical tomes to science-fiction and fantasy novels.</p>
