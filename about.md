Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the world. This site is primarily about my professional and creative side.. so it is a bit of a mix code and crochet.

I am a wife and mom of four boys (19, 16, 2, <1) and two dogs. We live in the middle of farm country, in a cute little town on the Jersey side of the Delaware River. I love all things where art and science intersect: baking, crocheting, hacking, gardening, puzzles.. and reverse engineering anything I find interesting. My simple pleasure, though, is reading... anything from biographies and Biblical tomes to science-fiction and fantasy novels.

Currently, I work for a clean-air industrial engineering firm. One of three in our IT group, I am the (developer | designer | dba) Jane-of-all-trades and pretty much anything they need from me. :)

Feel free to contact me any time.
