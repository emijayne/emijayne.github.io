Hi there!  Welcome to my little corner of the world. :smirk:

Feel free to poke around. This site is primarily about my professional and creative side.. so it is a bit of a mix code and crochet.

Personally, I am a wife and mom of four boys and two dogs. We live in the middle of farm country, in a cute little town on the Delaware River.

If I find a smidgen of spare time, you'll find me baking, crocheting, tinkering with code, or maybe even digging in dirt. Most often, though, you'll find me reading - anything from biographies and Biblical tomes to science-fiction and fantasy novels.. I love it all. (and often, thanks to Kindle)

Two confessions.

First, I am a puzzle dork. I will sit for hours or days working on puzzles. They don't just have to be jigsaw puzzles - I love physical or technological problems equally. I will offer the same devotion to untangling a jumbled ball of thread as I would to analysing the mapping in a convoluted and non-relational data set for migration. I find complications to simply be fun challenges to work through.

Second, I have a love affair with efficiency. After working for a decade in varying stages of office administration, I deeply understand systems and how they interconnect. Not only with each other but with the people using them. At my current company, I made successful use of this knowledge - making work easier for the people I supported - and was promoted in return. I moved into IT (programming / development) for the same reason: so that I could make efficient systems for our team mates, and therefore, make their work-life an easier one. It makes me cringe when I see an inefficient system, and have often volunteered to recreate these... OK, it might be more than a love affair. (I really do love jigsaw puzzles...)

Currently, I work for a clean-air engineering firm. One of three in our IT group, I am the developer/ designer/ programmer/ dba.. Jane-of-all-trades and pretty much anything they need from me. :)

You'll have to jump over to my [resume](/resume) to find the details.
