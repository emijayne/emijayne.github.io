	Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the world. This site is primarily about my professional and creative side.. so it is a bit of a mix code and crochet.

	I am a wife and mom of four boys and two dogs. We live in the middle of farm country, in a cute little town on the Jersey side of the Delaware River.

	I love all things where art and science intersect: baking, crocheting, programming, gardening, puzzles.. and reverse engineering anything I find interesting. My simple pleasure, though, is reading... anything from biographies and Biblical tomes to science-fiction and fantasy novels.

	Feel free to contact me any time - see various mediums below.
