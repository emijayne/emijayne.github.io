<span style="color: #000000;">This </span><a style="color: #9d3707;" title="Bulk Rename Utility" href="http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulk Rename Utility</a><span style="color: #000000;"> for Windows is just.. pure awesomeness.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">I had about 25 albums of pictures that needed to be renamed before uploading to our photo gallery at work.  Once I decided on a format that I wanted to use.. it took me only about 30 minutes to go through them all.. well.. </span>minus time for talking, resizing other albums and running to the vending machine for desperately needed chocolate..  <img src="http://www.emijayne.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I know that it may look a little overwhelming at first, but .. wow.  It is so amazing how simple it is to completely scrap names and rewrite, or remove one character, or give it the album name with an added suffix.. not to mention using RegEx awesomeness.

I love it.. and I think you will too!!
