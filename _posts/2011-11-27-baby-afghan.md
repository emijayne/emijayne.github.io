After a few emails back and forth she decided on this adorable blanket by Lion Brand.

<p style="color: #000000;">
  Nardea wanted me to keep the color scheme.. which I love! The only difference is the yarn I&#8217;m using. She really wanted the organic cotton that the pattern suggests, because she figured that it would keep the baby warmer. <img src="http://www.emijayne.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Good thought. However.. it&#8217;s not machine washable. Could you imagine having a baby blanket that you couldn&#8217;t machine wash?! Horrifying!! ðŸ˜‰

  I decided to run out to Michael&#8217;s over one lunch break to buy a few different yarns for sampling. You see, I&#8217;m not sure of the name of this type of spinning, but the suggested organic yarn is basically streams of tiny threads wrapped at an angle with a thicker string, and I really didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d like it. It is really pretty but very easily frayed. Baby girl would shred that within a year! She agreed that it would be silly to use. I found this other yarn, a cotton-acrylic blend calledÂ <a style="color: #9d3707;" href="http://www.lionbrand.com/yarns/babysfirst.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby&#8217;s First</a>, that is not only machine-washable but still quite soft and shred-resistant. AND you can get it in cuteÂ names such as &#8220;Pixie Dust&#8221;, &#8220;Fairy Tale&#8221; and &#8220;Beanstalk&#8221;.
