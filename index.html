  <article class="post-content">
	<p><span class="post-title">Hello there...</span> and welcome to my little corner of the world. This site is primarily about my professional and creative side.. so it is a bit of a mix code and crochet.</p>

	<p>I am a wife and mom of four boys and two dogs. We live in the middle of farm country, in a cute little town on the Jersey side of the Delaware River.</p>

	<p>I love all things where art and science intersect: baking, crocheting, programming, gardening, puzzles.. and reverse engineering anything I find interesting. My simple pleasure, though, is reading... anything from biographies and Biblical tomes to science-fiction and fantasy novels.</p>

	<p>Feel free to contact me any time - see various mediums below.</p>
