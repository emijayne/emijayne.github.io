	<p>Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the world. This site is primarily about my professional and creative side.. so it is a bit of a mix code and crochet.</p>

  <p>My interests and passions lie where art and science intersect: programming, baking, crocheting, mechanics, gardening, puzzles.. and reverse engineering anything I find interesting. My simple pleasure, though, is reading... anything from biographies and Biblical tomes to science-fiction and fantasy novels.</p>

	<p>Professionally, I am a multifaceted programmer. I really love creating systems for my end users efficient, easy and beautiful. Because of this, I am constantly learning new technologies, languages and techniques.</p>

	<p>Personally, I live in a cute little farm town on the Jersey side of the Delaware River with my husband, four boys and two dogs.</p>
